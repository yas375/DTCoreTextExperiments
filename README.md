This example project demonstrates strange bug with DTCoreText installed as a CocoaPod which leads to plenty of memory leaks.

Here is [screenshot](http://content.screencast.com/users/yas375/folders/Jing/media/326cd214-ff4c-41e2-8d5f-a9f6adc8a316/00000277.png) of instruments screen.

But sometimes app runs without leaks. See run at 3:00 in my screencast: http://screencast.com/t/8h286L8ww
